# I2C-scanner
 In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of I2C communication, the functions available for I2C in ModusToolbox, and how to get started with I2C on the PSoC 6 board.

I2C Basics
I2C is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched serial communication protocol. It uses two bidirectional lines for communication:

SCL (Serial Clock): This line carries the clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transmission between devices.

SDA (Serial Data): This bidirectional line carries the data being transmitted between devices.

Key concepts of I2C:

Master and Slave Devices: In an I2C network, there is typically one master and one or more slave devices. The master initiates data transfers, and slaves respond to requests.

7-Bit or 10-Bit Addressing: Each I2C device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address that allows the master to select a specific slave for communication.

Start and Stop Conditions: Communication begins with a start condition and ends with a stop condition. These are generated by the master to indicate the beginning and end of a transaction.

Data Transfer: Data is sent in 8-bit bytes, and each byte is acknowledged by the receiving device. Data can be sent in both directions (read and write).

I2C Functions in ModusToolbox
ModusToolbox provides a set of functions and drivers for working with I2C. Here are some common I2C functions you can use:

Initialization:

cyhal_i2c_init(): Initialize the I2C peripheral with the desired pins and configuration.
Configuration:

cyhal_i2c_configure(): Set the I2C bus speed and other parameters.
cyhal_i2c_frequency(): Set or get the bus frequency.
Data Transfer:

cyhal_i2c_master_read(): Read data from a slave device.
cyhal_i2c_master_write(): Write data to a slave device.
Addressing:

cyhal_i2c_set_slave_address(): Set the address of the slave device.
cyhal_i2c_get_address(): Get the current slave address.
Other Functions:

cyhal_i2c_is_busy(): Check if the I2C bus is busy.
cyhal_i2c_get_direction(): Get the current data transfer direction (read or write).
Using I2C on PSoC 6 CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
Here's a general overview of how to use I2C on the PSoC 6 board:

Hardware Setup:

Connect your I2C devices to the I2C pins on the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board.
Configure your I2C device addresses.
Project Setup:

Create a new project in ModusToolbox and select the appropriate board and target.
Make sure the I2C component is enabled in the project configuration.
Initialize I2C:

Use cyhal_i2c_init() to initialize the I2C hardware with the desired pins.
Configure I2C:

Use cyhal_i2c_configure() to set the desired bus speed and other parameters.
Data Transfer:

Use cyhal_i2c_master_read() to read data from a slave device or cyhal_i2c_master_write() to send data to a slave device.
Error Handling:

Check the return values of I2C functions for errors and handle them appropriately.
Completion and Cleanup:

Ensure that data transfer is complete before proceeding.
Release I2C resources with cyhal_i2c_free() when done.
Summary
I2C is a versatile communication protocol that allows for easy connectivity between various devices in an embedded system. ModusToolbox provides a set of functions and drivers to simplify I2C integration into your projects. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can get started with I2C communication on the PSoC 6 CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board and other supported PSoC platforms. Always refer to the device datasheets and documentation for specific I2C addresses and device configurations.
